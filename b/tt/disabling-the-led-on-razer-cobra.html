<h1>Disabling the LED on a new Razer Cobra</h1>

<p><i>14 January 2025</i></p>

<p>
Recently my mouse began to die and I went searching for a replacement. I wanted something not too cheap but also not too expensive and gamery and eventually picked up a <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-cobra">Razer Cobra</a>. It's wired, nice and light, doesn't have an excess of buttons, and it's supposedly suitable for my style of mouse grip ("fingertip", according to companies who make mice). It's only been a few days but so far I'm quite happy with it. It's responsive and feels nice to use, though the button clicks are pretty loud.
</p>

<p>
I plugged this into a system running Debian testing (trixie) and had no intention of doing any sort of fancy mouse customisations, let alone letting <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/razer-bug-lets-you-become-a-windows-10-admin-by-plugging-in-a-mouse/">using Razer's own software for anything</a>. Unfortunately for me, it came out of the box with a very bright RGB-illuminated logo on the top that is continuously cycling through colours. I was thinking about just putting a sticker over it when I noticed that there is a very shmick <a href="https://openrazer.github.io/">OpenRazer project</a> to facilitate controlling these Razer peripherals on Linux, so I thought I would give that a go. I would tolerate installing a bit of one-off software but I wanted to avoid adding custom apt repos or installing anything wildly unmaintained.
</p>

<p>
Complete success: my LED is now off.
</p>

<p>
First install the required Debian packages:
</p>

<pre>
apt install openrazer-meta python3-pip
</pre>

<p>
Then reboot the machine to let the driver take effect.
</p>

<p>
Install <tt>razer-cli</tt>, a CLI configuration tool written in Python. It needs to use the system openrazer install so I passed <tt>--break-system-packages</tt>, but to contain any chaos to my own user I also passed <tt>--user</tt>. This has the ultimate result that the program works and is installed at <tt>~/.local/bin/razer-cli</tt>.
</p>

<pre>
pip3 install razer-cli --user --break-system-packages
</pre>

<p>
Hooray, it works:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>./.local/bin/razer-cli -l</b>

<p>
Now let's set that brightness down to zero.
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>./.local/bin/razer-cli -b 0</b>

Adding new settings entry

<p>
All done. Nice.
