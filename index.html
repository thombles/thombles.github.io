<h2>About me, briefly</h2>

<p>
I'm a generalist programmer who lives in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania">Tasmania, Australia</a>. Since 2019 I've worked with <a href="https://ditto.com/">Ditto</a> where I led development of its cross-platform P2P mesh networking for around five years, including Bluetooth LE and WiFi. Nowadays I'm a "Staff Software Engineer" in the security team working on AppSec and developing security-related features.
</p>

<p>
Given the choice I enjoy working in Go and Rust. I technically have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dodgycoding8727/">a YouTube channel about Rust programming<a> but it hasn't had any new videos for a while. I don't use AI or any other automatic plagiarism tools in my writing or software development.
</p>

<p>
I was once an AV/automation tech and did a lot of unusual work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Old_and_New_Art">MONA</a>. One of my assignments was to waterproof a microphone so it could be buried in a worm farm. I also wrote the script that told Julius Popp's <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Structure_at_MONA.jpg"><i>bit.fall</i></a> which words to display. It was widely misreported to be showing Google searches; in fact it was taking words from Google News Australia's RSS feed. It's probably been changed since.
